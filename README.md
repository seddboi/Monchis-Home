## Monchi's World

# Description

Monchi's World is a simple Full-Stack application thayt I built for my girlfriend, as a birthday gift. This project serves as a simple full-stack application, protected by her own password.

# Technology

This project started off as a simple front-end application, built with React and the Tailwind CSS library. It was meant to serve as a web collage of images, of our timeline together. Upon further development, I decided I wanted to include a simple backend for the application, as I wanted to provide a simple API that could password-protect the site. Thus, I created a back-end which provides password access checking and an API which provides random facts about her (all facts were provided by me). This back-end server was built uzing NodeJS and Express handling the routing.

\*\*\* As it is password protected by my very protective girlfriend, user access is allocated to her and only her.
